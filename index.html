    <h2>Motivation: Healthcare Challenges Around the World</h2>
    
    <h3>In Tunisia:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Uneven distribution of healthcare services across regions</li>
      <li>Inadequate funding for public healthcare</li>
      <li>A shortage of medical professionals due to high-skilled immigration</li>
      <li>Poor access to specialized care</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>In America:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No national health insurance, which goes against universal healthcare and SDGs devised by the UN</li>
      <li>Millions of Americans remain uninsured, underinsured, or unsure of their coverage</li>
      <li>The leading cause of personal bankruptcy is medical debt</li>
      <li>Healthcare is inaccessible to underprivileged and underrepresented communities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Healthcare stands as a fundamental pillar in any society, holding a central place in building
      resilient and sustainable nations. I want to contribute my efforts towards the achievement
      of human security and a global society that leaves no one’s health behind, using technology.

  <!-- SkinGuardian's Focus Section -->
  <section>
    <h2>SkinGuardian’s Focus: Why Skin Cancer?</h2>
    <p>Skin Cancer is the most common cancer in the United States and worldwide.<br/>
       It can affect anyone, regardless of skin color.</p>
    
    <h3>Skin Cancer Risk Factors:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>UV light exposure</li>
      <li>Skin type</li>
      <li>Family / personal history of skin cancer</li>
      <li>Weak immune system</li>
      <li>Age</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Skin Cancer is the cancer you can see. That’s why skin exams, both at home and with a
      dermatologist, are especially vital.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Early detection saves lives.</strong> Learning what to look for on your own skin 
      gives you the power to detect cancer early when it’s easiest to cure, before it 
      can become dangerous, disfiguring or deadly.

  <!-- SkinGuardian Intro Section -->
  <section>
    <h2>That is why I am working on: SkinGuardian</h2>
    <p>
      An AI-powered digital companion for the early detection of skin cancer
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Vision Section -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Vision Behind SkinGuardian</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Classify skin lesions</li>
      <li>Generate medically accurate clinical insights</li>
      <li>Support self-conducted skin exams, especially when access to dermatologists is limited</li>
      <li>Help in the prevention of skin cancer through personalized recommendations and lifestyle factors tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ultimately, support early detection—when treatment is most effective.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Scope / Tools Section -->
  <section>
    <h2>Scope and Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Since my vision for SkinGuardian was too ambitious for the limited time span that I had,
      I decided to focus on its main functionality: <strong>Classifying Skin Lesions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>To reach this goal, this was my toolset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Framework:</strong> PyTorch</li>
      <li><strong>IDE:</strong> Google Colab</li>
      <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> HAM10000</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    
    <!-- SkinGuardian V0 -->
    <p>
      • <strong>Deploy “SkinGuardian” as a web/mobile app</strong> that provides accessible skin lesion diagnostics for both patients and clinicians, making early detection easier and more widespread.
    </p>
  
    <!-- SkinGuardian V1 -->
    <p>
      • <strong>Leverage fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</strong> to generate more accurate clinical diagnoses. This next iteration—<em>SkinGuardian V1</em>—could integrate comprehensive medical literature to provide context-aware advice.
    </p>
  
    <!-- Continuous Improvement -->
    <p>
      • <strong>Train the model with auxiliary tasks</strong> (e.g., risk-factor assessment, lesion segmentation) and keep iterating on functionalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Through this project, I have witnessed firsthand how <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> can be harnessed to address critical healthcare challenges. From detecting skin cancer early to providing personalized recommendations, AI holds tremendous promise for improving patient outcomes and saving lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the <strong>transformative power of technology</strong>. I want to continue dedicating my skills and passion toward healthcare innovations, using AI to <em>help people</em>, uplift underrepresented communities, and <strong>make the world a better place</strong>. By combining cutting-edge research with a mission-driven approach, we can move closer to a future where quality healthcare is accessible for everyone.
